<h1>Welcome to the Imaginarium!</h1>

<p>
My name Isabel Fisher.
I've been working, researching and innovating in the information technology field since I first fell in love with educational video games and built my first gaming computer.
It's hard to sum up my interests in one title, but lately "System Integration" has seemed the most fitting.
A fun challenge for me is making sure all the parts of a project fit together in ways that balance scale, cost, and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Over the years it's also been fun to observe evolving trends in technology globalization, intergraion and implementation.
How different people and places discover, implement, and use technology is interesting and key to understanding a lot of the current trends in Web3, AI, and data science.
The world is evolving, and the entire technology industry along with it.
</p>
<p>
I hope that you'll enjoy learning with me and discussing the fascinating ways we shape technology, and also how technology shapes us.
