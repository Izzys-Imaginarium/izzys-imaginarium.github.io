<h2>Validify Platform (Patent Pending)</h2>
<p>The Validify Platform is intended to leverage AI and blockchain technology to ease and automate project management, setup, configuration, and reporting.
  Data and reports are stored in blockchain to allow ease of collection of data and reports useful for project auditing and optimization. By storing these files in a separate location
  the access is controlled and can be accessed without putting the underlying data, code, or internal business systems at risk.
  
  Benefits:
  - This will greatly reduce auditing headaches for most companies in both time spent preparing and interruptions to process.
  - The company may be able to loosen security requirements for auditors when the data is pre-cleaned and no longer stored in internal systems.
  - Collecting this data throughout the normal project lifecycle also allows for better management and estimations of project budgets and the impact of desired changes.
  
  Individual contributors to the project are also given an NFT badge that can be used to track and display their individual contributions to a project independent of the company and project.
  This will allow ease of hiring and more granular and verifiable proof of developer skill, efficiency, and quality.
  
  Benefits:
  - Individual contributors get "proof of contribution" to a project that proves their skill and contribution
  - These NFT tokens are highly portable and can even be stored on an NFC chip or on a cell phone
  - This will reduce hiring time and cost overhead for validify customers hiring employees or contractors that have worked on "Validified" projects in the past as verifying their experience can be done quickly and easily without human intervention.
